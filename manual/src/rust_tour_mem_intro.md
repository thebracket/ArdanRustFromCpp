# Memory Management

Rust is a real systems language, with proper memory management. No garbage collector here! And with the great power of memory management, comes great responsibility to not accidentally leak your company's secrets or let remote users execute arbitrary code on your system.

Fortunately, Rust prioritizes *safety*---and also a *safety culture*, in which Rustaceans strive to create safe code.
